# Core Objective: Arbitrage Research & Monitoring Platform

## Primary Goal

Build a dashboard to answer critical questions for bot strategy development and decision-making.

---

## Key Research Questions

### 1. Viability Assessment
**Is arbitrage viable between these exchanges?**
- What's the frequency of profitable opportunities?
- What returns can realistically be expected?
- Is it worth the development effort and capital allocation?

### 2. Exchange Pair Selection
**Which exchange pairs are most profitable?**
- Which combinations yield the highest returns?
- Which pairs have the most frequent opportunities?
- Which exchanges should be prioritized or avoided?

### 3. Strategy Parameters
**What spread threshold should my bot use?**
- What minimum spread ensures profitability after all fees?
- How does threshold affect opportunity frequency?
- What's the optimal balance between selectivity and volume?

### 4. Timing & Scheduling
**When do opportunities appear?**
- What times of day are most profitable?
- Are there patterns by day of week?
- Should the bot run 24/7 or only during peak hours?

### 5. Performance Debugging
**What's causing failures?**
- Why is the bot missing opportunities?
- Which technical bottlenecks exist (API latency, balance issues, etc.)?
- How can execution be optimized?

### 6. Continuous Evaluation
**Should I continue/stop/optimize?**
- Is actual performance matching expectations?
- Are market conditions changing?
- Is capital being used efficiently?
- What optimizations would have the biggest impact?

## Platform Purpose

This is **not** a trading tool - it's a **research and monitoring platform** that:

✅ Informs bot development decisions with data  
✅ Validates strategies before deploying capital  
✅ Monitors live bot performance  
✅ Identifies optimization opportunities  
✅ Provides realistic profit expectations  

❌ Does not execute trades  
❌ Does not provide real-time trading signals  
❌ Does not promise get-rich-quick results  

---

## Success Criteria

The platform is successful if it helps you make informed decisions about:

1. **Whether to build** an arbitrage bot at all
2. **Where to focus** development efforts (which exchanges/pairs)
3. **How to optimize** execution (latency, fees, capital allocation)
4. **When to run** the bot (scheduling and monitoring)
5. **Whether to continue** or pivot strategy based on results

---

## Target Outcome

Use data-driven insights to either:
- Build a profitable arbitrage bot with realistic expectations, or
- Conclude that arbitrage isn't viable and avoid wasting time/capital

Either outcome is valuable - the goal is making informed decisions, not false promises.
